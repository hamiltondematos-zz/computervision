Ex 3.28: 

Image denoising 

Implement at least two of the various image denoising techniques
described in this chapter and compare them on both synthetically noised image sequences
and real-world (low-light) sequences. Does the performance of the algorithm depend
on the correct choice of noise level estimate? Can you draw any conclusions as to
which techniques work better?

Used to be linear filtering
Today - non-linear filtering:
	3.3.1-weighted median
	3.34, 3.37-bilateral filter
	3.39, 3.40-anisotropic diffusion
	Non-local means

12 ou 14

box filter - low pass average
             high pass


median filter - ficou melhor

minimum - tudo preto

gaussian filter
