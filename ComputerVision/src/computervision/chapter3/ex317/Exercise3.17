Deblurring using Wiener filtering 
Use Wiener filtering to deblur some images.

1. Modify the Wiener filter derivation (3.66–3.74) to incorporate blur (3.75).

2. Discuss the resulting Wiener filter in terms of its noise suppression and frequency
boosting characteristics.

3. Assuming that the blur kernel is Gaussian and the image spectrum follows an inverse
frequency law, compute the frequency response of the Wiener filter, and compare it to
the unsharp mask.

4. Synthetically blur two of your sample images with Gaussian blur kernels of different
radii, add noise, and then perform Wiener filtering.

5. Repeat the above experiment with a “pillbox” (disc) blurring kernel, which is characteristic
of a finite aperture lens (Section 2.2.3). Compare these results to Gaussian blur
kernels (be sure to inspect your frequency plots).

6. It has been suggested that regular apertures are anathema to de-blurring because they
introduce zeros in the sensed frequency spectrum (Veeraraghavan, Raskar, Agrawal et
al. 2007). Show that this is indeed an issue if no prior model is assumed for the signal,
i.e., P􀀀1
s l1. If a reasonable power spectrum is assumed, is this still a problem (do we
still get banding or ringing artifacts)?lso be supported (for each rectangle, save its transformation).
