Ex 14.1: 

Face detection 

Build and test one of the face detectors presented in Section 14.1.1.

1. Download one or more of the labeled face detection databases in Table 14.2.

2. Generate your own negative examples by finding photographs that do not contain any
people.

3. Implement one of the following face detectors (or devise one of your own):
 boosting (Algorithm 14.1) based on simple area features, with an optional cascade
of detectors (Viola and Jones 2004);
 PCA face subspace (Moghaddam and Pentland 1997);
 distances to clustered face and non-face prototypes, followed by a neural network
(Sung and Poggio 1998) or SVM (Osuna, Freund, and Girosi 1997) classifier;
 a multi-resolution neural network trained directly on normalized gray-level patches
(Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade 1998a).

4. Test the performance of your detector on the database by evaluating the detector at every
location in a sub-octave pyramid. Optionally retrain your detector on false positive
examples you get on non-face images.
