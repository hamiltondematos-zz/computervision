Ex 4.2: 

Interest point descriptor 

Implement one or more descriptors (steered to local scale
and orientation) and compare their performance (with your own or with a classmateâ€™s detector).
Some possible descriptors include
contrast-normalized patches (Brown, Szeliski, and Winder 2005);
SIFT (Lowe 2004);
GLOH (Mikolajczyk and Schmid 2005);
DAISY (Winder and Brown 2007; Tola, Lepetit, and Fua 2010).
Other detectors are described by Mikolajczyk and Schmid (2005).
