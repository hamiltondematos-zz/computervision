Ex 7.2: Essential and fundamental matrix Implement the two-frame E and F matrix estimation
techniques presented in Section 7.2, with suitable re-scaling for better noise immunity.
1. Use the data from Exercise 7.1 to validate your algorithms and to report on their accuracy.
2. (Optional) Implement one of the improved F or E estimation algorithms, e.g., using
renormalization (Zhang 1998b; Torr and Fitzgibbon 2004; Hartley and Zisserman
2004), RANSAC (Torr and Murray 1997), least media squares (LMS), or the five-point
algorithm developed by NistÂ´er (2004).
