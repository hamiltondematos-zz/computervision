Skin color detection 

Devise a simple skin color detector (Forsyth and Fleck 1999;
Jones and Rehg 2001; Vezhnevets, Sazonov, and Andreeva 2003; Kakumanu, Makrogiannis,
and Bourbakis 2007) based on chromaticity or other color properties.

1. Take a variety of photographs of people and calculate the xy chromaticity values for
each pixel.

2. Crop the photos or otherwise indicate with a painting tool which pixels are likely to be
skin (e.g. face and arms).

3. Calculate a color (chromaticity) distribution for these pixels. You can use something as
simple as a mean and covariance measure or as complicated as a mean-shift segmentation
algorithm (see Section 5.3.2). You can optionally use non-skin pixels to model the
background distribution.

4. Use your computed distribution to find the skin regions in an image. One easy way to
visualize this is to paint all non-skin pixels a given color, such as white or black.

5. How sensitive is your algorithm to color balance (scene lighting)?

6. Does a simpler chromaticity measurement, such as a color ratio (2.116), work just as
well?
