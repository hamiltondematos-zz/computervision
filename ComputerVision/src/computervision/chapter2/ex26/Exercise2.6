Ex 2.6: 

Noise level calibration 

Estimate the amount of noise in your camera by taking repeated
shots of a scene with the camera mounted on a tripod. (Purchasing a remote shutter
release is a good investment if you own a DSLR.) Alternatively, take a scene with constant
color regions (such as a color checker chart) and estimate the variance by fitting a smooth
function to each color region and then taking differences from the predicted function.

1. Plot your estimated variance as a function of level for each of your color channels
separately.

2. Change the ISO setting on your camera; if you cannot do that, reduce the overall light
in your scene (turn off lights, draw the curtains, wait until dusk). Does the amount of
noise vary a lot with ISO/gain?

3. Compare your camera to another one at a different price point or year of make. Is
there evidence to suggest that “you get what you pay for”? Does the quality of digital
cameras seem to be improving over time?
