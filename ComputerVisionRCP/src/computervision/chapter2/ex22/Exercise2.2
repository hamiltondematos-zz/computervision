Ex 2.2: 

2D transform editor 

Write a program that lets you interactively create a set of
rectangles and then modify their “pose” (2D transform). 
You should implement the following steps:

1. Open an empty window (“canvas”).

2. Shift drag (rubber-band) to create a new rectangle.

3. Select the deformation mode (motion model): 
translation, 
rigid (2D rigid body motion or the 2D Euclidean transformation ) 
similarity (Scaled rotation), 
affine, or
perspective.

4. Drag any corner of the outline to change its transformation.

This exercise should be built on a set of pixel coordinate and transformation classes, either
implemented by yourself or from a software library. Persistence of the created representation
(save and load) should also be supported (for each rectangle, save its transformation).
